Stream Local is a premium, highly customizable web interface for discovering and streaming movies and TV shows. Hosted entirely on GitHub Pages, it acts as a lightweight aggregator that pulls metadata from TMDB and connects to third-party streaming servers—all while actively blocking intrusive popup ads.

## ✨ Features

* **Universal Streaming:** Watch almost any movie or TV show directly from your browser.
* **Built-in Popup Blocker:** Aggressive, multi-layered popup and redirect prevention so you can watch without interruption.
* **Customizable UI:** Choose between Dark, Light, and "Chill" themes, alongside Classic, Glassy, or Redesign layouts.
* **Bring Your Own Sources:** Easily add, manage, and prioritize custom third-party streaming server URLs in the settings.
* **Personalized Watchlist:** Save your favorite shows and movies to your local list.
* **Data Portability:** Export and import your profile (watch history, lists, API keys, and custom sources) as a JSON file.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewing.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Stream Local runs entirely in your browser. No server setup or installation is required! 

1. Go to the [Live Site](https://streamlocal.github.io/).
2. **Configure Streaming Sources (Optional):**
   * The app comes with default 3rd-party providers. You can manage these or add your own custom video server templates in the Settings menu.
3. **Search and Watch:** Use the search bar to find content or browse the trending/popular carousels on the homepage.

## ⚙️ How It Works

This project is a static single-page application (SPA) contained entirely within `index.html`. It utilizes plain HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. 

* **Metadata:** Fetched via TMDB API.
* **Video Playback:** Handled by dynamically embedding third-party host URLs into an iframe.
* **Storage:** All watchlists, history, and settings are saved locally to your browser's `localStorage`.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

We have no control over the media put up by third-party sites. All legal issues, DMCA requests, or copyright takedowns should be directed to the respective third-party platforms hosting the files.
